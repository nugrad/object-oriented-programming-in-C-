//1. Which Feature of OOP illustrated the code reusability? Explain with examples.
/* ---> INHERITANCE
example: for example there is a base class named as animal which has memeber functions of eat and sleep 
so every animal has these attributes and its inherits these attributes from being an animal
class Animal {
    // eat() function
    // sleep() function
};

class Dog : public Animal {
    // bark() function
};*/
// What is the difference between encapsulation and Abstraction? Explain with a real time example
/* encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a method of making a complex system easier to handle for end users.
the user need not worry about internal details and complexities of the system.
Encapsulation is a process of wrapping the data and the code, that operate on the data into a single entity.
EXAMPLE;
When you log into your email accounts such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Rediff mail, there is a lot of internal processes taking place in the backend
and you have no control over it.

------------
abstraction:
Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that shows only essential attributes and hides unnecessary information.
The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.
EXAMPLE;
coffee machine,ou need to know how to use your coffee machine to make coffee,You need to provide water and coffee beans,
The thing you don’t need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally.
